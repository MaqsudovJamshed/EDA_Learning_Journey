Question. 

A new dataset named titanic has been uploaded for you in script.py. This data contains information about passengers on the Titanic, 
including the amount they paid for their fare and whether or not they survived (note: this is a subset of the full data available). 
To practice the skills learned in this lesson, let’s investigate whether there is an association between the fare that a passenger paid 
(Fare) and whether or not they survived (Survived, which is equal to 0 if the passenger died and 1 if they survived):

Calculate the difference in mean fare paid by those who survived and those who died. Which group paid a higher average fare?
Calculate the difference in median fare for those who survived and those who died.
Create side-by-side box plots of fares by survival. Now that you can see the spread of the data, do the mean/median differences seem relatively small or large?
Create overlapping histograms of fares by survival (you’ll have to delete or comment out your box plot code before you try to make a histogram). 
Does this provide any additional information?

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns
import codecademylib3

titanic = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')

print(titanic.head())

#separate out fares by survival
fares_died = titanic.Fare[titanic.Survived == 0]
fares_survived = titanic.Fare[titanic.Survived == 1]

#mean difference
mean_fare_died = np.mean(fares_died)
mean_fare_surv = np.mean(fares_survived)
mean_diff = mean_fare_surv-mean_fare_died
print('mean difference: ')
print(mean_diff)

#median difference
med_fare_died = np.median(fares_died)
med_fare_surv = np.median(fares_survived)
med_diff = med_fare_surv-med_fare_died
print("median difference: ")
print(med_diff)

#create subplots (scroll to see plots)
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (10,20))

#create the boxplot:
ax = fig.add_subplot(2,1,1)
ax = sns.boxplot(data = titanic, x = 'Survived', y = 'Fare')

#create the histograms:
ax = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2)
ax = plt.hist(fares_died, color="blue", label="Died", normed=True, alpha=0.5)
ax = plt.hist(fares_survived, color="red", label="Survived", normed=True, alpha=0.5)
ax = plt.legend()
plt.show()
