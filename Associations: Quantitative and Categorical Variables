Assessing the association between a quantitative variable and a categorical variable.


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import codecademylib3

students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')

scores_GP = students.G3[students.school == 'GP']
scores_MS = students.G3[students.school == 'MS']

#1 The dataset described above has been saved for you in the workspace as a Pandas dataframe named students. 
   Inspect the first five rows of students using the .head() method. Take a look at the other columns. Which are categorical and which are quantitative?

#print the first five rows of students:
print(students.head())

#separate out scores for students who live in urban and rural locations:

#2 Separate out G3 scores into two separate lists: one for students who live in an urban location ('U') and one for students who live in a rural location ('R'). Name these lists scores_urban and scores_rural.

#Urban
scores_urban = students.G3[students.address == 'U']
print(scores_urban)

#Rural
scores_rural = students.G3[students.address == 'R']
print(scores_rural)


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')

scores_urban = students.G3[students.address == 'U']
scores_rural = students.G3[students.address == 'R']

#(4) calculate means for each group:
scores_urban_mean = np.mean(scores_urban)
scores_rural_mean = np.mean(scores_rural)

#print mean scores:
print('Mean score - students w/ urban address:')
print(scores_urban_mean)
print('Mean score - students w/ rural address:')
print(scores_rural_mean)

#calculate mean difference:
mean_diff = scores_urban_mean-scores_rural_mean

#print mean difference
print('Mean difference:')
print(mean_diff)

#(5) calculate medians for each group:
scores_urban_median = np.median(scores_urban)
scores_rural_median = np.median(scores_rural)

#print median scores
print('Median score - students w/ urban address:')
print(scores_urban_median)
print('Median score - students w/ rural address:')
print(scores_rural_median)

#calculate median difference
median_diff = scores_urban_median-scores_rural_median

#print median difference
print('Median difference:')
print(median_diff)


# 5 create the boxplot here:
sns.boxplot(data = students, x ='address', y ='G3')
plt.show()
#Q: Is there any overlap between the boxes? Do you think the variables are associated?
            
                                                Answer : 
- Overlap Between Boxes: 
      Yes, there is some overlap between the interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the two groups (U and R). 
This suggests that the middle 50% of values for G3 in both groups have some common range. However, the medians are slightly different, 
with U having a higher median compared to R.

- Association Between Variables: 
      The presence of an overlap suggests there might not be a very strong association between address and G3. 
While there is a visible difference in central tendencies (medians), the variation within each group and the overlap indicate that the association 
might not be strong. 

A statistical test, such as a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, would be needed to determine whether this difference is statistically significant.

#6 create the overlapping histograms here:
plt.hist (scores_urban , color='blue',label='Urban', normed=True, alpha=0.5)

plt.hist(scores_rural, color='red', label='Rural', normed=True, alpha=0.5)
plt.legend()
plt.show()

#7 create the box-plot here:
Q: Do you think there is an association between these variables? For which pairs of groups do you see differences? 

sns.boxplot(data=students, x='Fjob', y='G3')
plt.show()
